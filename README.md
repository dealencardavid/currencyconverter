# CurrencyConverter

**A currency conversion tool, by David de Alencar**

## About

CurrencyConverter is more than just a tool; it's a passion project born out of the desire to apply the knowledge acquired during my journey into the world of React. As a migrant, the daily ritual of converting currencies became an integral part of my life. This challenge sparked the idea to build a solution that not only simplifies currency conversion but also encapsulates the essence of my learning journey.
